Table 3. Absorbance measurements for cell toxicity test. 
Control wells contained untreated HEK293T cells, and the treatment wells contained HEK293T cells incubated with a 16μg/ml dilution of the drug (in DMSO) for 24 h. The absorbance was measured at 570nm, according to manufacturer’s recommendations
