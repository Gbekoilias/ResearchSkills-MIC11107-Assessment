This assessment, part of the Research Skills module (MIC11107), involves critically reviewing and interpreting data from two pilot studies. 
The first study examines the effectiveness of the drug ExobeseTM in treating obesity in mice, while the second evaluates the anti-microbial effects and cell toxicity of a novel compound.
Students are tasked with explaining and justifying interpretations of the data, discussing the results' implications, and proposing improvements to the experimental design and analysis for both studies. 
The assessment emphasizes identifying weaknesses, providing scientific justifications for proposed changes, and adhering to the APA7th format for references. 
With a 40% weighting, successful completion of this task requires a comprehensive understanding of research skills, experimental design, and data analysis techniques.
